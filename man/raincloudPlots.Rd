\arguments{
\item{colorAnyway, }{Applies the color palette to the levels of the primary factor. Otherwise, the plot stays black and white.<br>This option is superseeded by a secondary factor; then color coding is according to that.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{colorPalette, }{How to color code the levels of the secondary factor.}

\item{covariate, }{Points are color coded according to this.}

\item{covariatePalette, }{How to color code the covariate. 'Viridis' works good for both discrete and continuous covariates.}

\item{customAxisLimits, }{Use this with care!<br>If your dataset has observations that lie outside of the specified, the plot will be truncated and it will not show these observations.<br>The limits you specify may only be applied approximately. For further fine-tuning of the axis, click the title of the plot where it says the name of dependent variable.<br>Then select 'Edit Image' in the drop down menu and then go to the headers 'x-axis' or 'y-axis'.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{dependentVariables, }{Select all the variables that you want to plot.}

\item{horizontal, }{Plots the dependent variable axis horizontally, at the bottom of the plot.<br>This is where the raincloud plot gets its name from: It will look like the points are raining from the violin and box (cloud).
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{mean, }{Whether to also show a mean for each cloud.<h4>Position</h4>Use a 'Custom' position to have the mean placed inside of the box - even if you do not show the box.<br>In fact, the mean nudge and distance fields are synchronized with the box nudge and box fields, respectively.<br>Use the 'On axis ticks' position to have all means for each primary factor level on top of each other.<br>This can be useful if you want to show the change of secondary factor levels (e.g. groups) across the primary factor levels (e.g. time).<h4>Size</h4>Try different values to make your plot especially pretty.<h4>Mean Lines: Width</h4>See outline width of box and violin as well as ID lines width.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{meanInterval, }{Whether to also show an interval around the mean.<br>This hides and disables the box.<br><br>You can choose between a confidence interval, ±1 standard error, or ±1  standard deviation.<br>For the computation of the confidence interval/se/sd, within and between factors are determined based on the specifciation of the ID variable<br><h4>
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{numberOfClouds, }{To apply custom cloud orientation or custom mean intervals, you first must specify the number of clouds that are currently shown in the plot.<br>If the number you entered does not match the number of clouds in the plot, the plot caption will show a warning and you can correct your entry.<br>The number you specify determines the number of rows in the table.<br><br>In the table, you can then specify the custom orientation ('L' vs. 'R') for each cloud as well as custom lower and upper interval limits for each mean.<br>Make sure to also check the corresponding checkboxes 'Apply custom orientation' or 'Apply custom mean interval limits'.<br>Otherwise, your input into the table will not be applied.<br><br>The order in which the rows of the table are mapped to the clouds in the plot is as follows:<br>Suppose, there are three times of measurement (primary factor): pre, post, and follow-up.<br>Further, there are two species (secondary factor): alpha and beta.<br>This means that there are 6 clouds, in the following order:<br>pre-alpha<br>pre-beta<br>post-alpha<br>post-beta<br>follow-up-alpha<br>follow-up-beta<br><br>In this example you could now specify the odd rows as 'L' and the even rows as 'R'.<br>That way, at each time point, the left cloud would be alpha and the right cloud would be beta.<br>If you have a 2x2 design (e.g. no follow-up in as primary factor), then a useful custom orientation could be LLRR.<br>That way, both the alpha and the beta cloud at time point pre would be left and at time point they would be right.<br>Combine this with ID input to connect the individual observations over time.<br>They will then run between the two clouds on the left to the two clouds on the right.<br><br>Any custom orientation or mean intervals will be applied to the plot of every dependent variable.<br>How can you specify different custom mean intervals for two dependent variables?<br>For this, you can duplicate the analysis (see symbol: white plus on green background),<br>only select one dependent variable in each version, and specify the custom intervals separately.<br><br>For custom cloud colors, just enter the hexcode you want. This features only works when there is no Secondary Factor.}

\item{observationId, }{Select a participant/observation ID in your dataset, to connect individual observations (points) accross the levels of the primary factor. Otherwise, you do not need this.}

\item{primaryFactor, }{Its levels are shown on the x-axis (y-axis for horizontal plot).}

\item{secondaryFactor, }{Its levels are color coded.}

\item{showBox, }{Whether or not the box should be shown. If un-checked, opacity is set to 0 and outline to 'none'.<br>An interval around the mean disables the box altogether.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{showCaption, }{The caption provides important information about the plot such as warnings, if there are any.<br>We strongly recommend to leave this checkbox checked and to only un-check it if you are otherwise happy with the plot and want to export it.<h3>Plot Size: Width and Height</h3>This also includes the legend (if there is color coding) and the caption.<br>While you can also change the size of a JASP plot with your mouse, the precise specification of width and height allows you to exactly reproduce a plot.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{showLegend, }{Shows the legend for the color-coding of the primary factor.<br>This option is superseeded by a secondary factor; then the legend is always added.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{showPoint, }{Whether or not the points of a cloud should be shown. If un-checked, opacity is set to 0.<br>If you have many, many points, it can be helpful to hide them.<br><br><h3>Element Settings</h3><h4>Nudge</h4>The nudge for violin, box, and point determines how far the elements are nudged from the center (axis tick).<br>By default, the box is in the center (nudge = 0) and the violin is nudged to the right. The points are nudged to the left of the box.<br>With a custom orientation (see Advanced section), the points get centered (nudge fixed to 0). Violin and box are nudged depending on orientation: left or right.<h4>Height, Width, and Spread</h4>These settings determine the respective properties of the elements:<br><br>How high should the violin peak? (Does not change the proportions of the probability density.)<br>With a custom orientation to the left (see Advanced Section), it can be helpful to decrease the height if the violin overlaps with axis ticks.<br><br>How wide should the box be?<br><br>How wide should the points spread? I.e., how jittered should they be along the x-axis (y-axis if horizontal plot?.<br>Note, that this still correctly shows the values of the points on the dependent variable axis.<br>(If you would also like y-jitter see the 'Jitter' option for points.)<h4>Box Padding</h4>With a secondary factor, there will be a box for each factor level. With the padding, you can change the spacing between theses boxes.<br>Increasing the padding will - visually - decrease the box width. If you want to keep box width constant, also increase the box width.<h4>Point Size</h4>We recommend a greater size, the fewer points you have.<h4>Opacity</h4>Increase this to _decrease_ the transparency of the respective element.<h4>Outline and Outline Width</h4>Would you like the outline to match the 'Color palette', be 'black', or have 'none' at all?<br>The width determines how thick the outline is.<h4>Violin Smoothing</h4>This percentage determines the smoothness of the probability density.<br>The lower, the stronger it is influenced by the presence/absence of individual points.<h4>Point Jitter</h4>Use this with care!<br>It slightly jitters the points along the dependent variable axis. This means that the position of the points no longer matches the values of the observations.<br>If you want to have less overlap between the points while keeping an accurate visualization, increases the point spread.<br>Using point jitter can be useful in some cases. For example, if you are working with likert data.<h4>ID Lines Width</h4>Determines how thick the lines are.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{showVio, }{Whether or not the violin should be shown. If un-checked, opacity is set to 0 and outline to 'none'.
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{table, }{Shows a table under the plot with statistics per cloud, like number of observations or median.<br>If you select 'Mean' or 'Interval around mean' (see Advanced Section), they will also be shown here.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{tableBoxStatistics, }{Shows the box statistics in the table: lower whisker, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, upper whisker.<br>It can be helpful to un-check this if you are also working with 'Interval around mean' (see Advanced Section).
Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
